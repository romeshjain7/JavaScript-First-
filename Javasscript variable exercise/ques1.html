    <p>Javascript Variables Exercise
    
        Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

        var a = "3"; 
        var b = "8"; 

        So that the variable a holds the value "8".
        
        And the variable b holds the value "3".
        
        When the code is run, it should output:
        
        a is 8
        b is 3
        
        Do NOT change any of the existing code.
        
        You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.
        
        You should NOT redeclare the variables a and b.</p> </pre>
